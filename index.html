                    <p class="gen-ans">We know this seems like a really boring suggestion, but seriously - the amount of accidents and even deaths caused by head injuries have made many resorts set rules to make helmets mandatory when on the slopes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pt-3">
                    <p class="gen-quest mb-2">Dress smart</p>
                    <p class="gen-ans">First timers always seem to make the same mistake - you don't need to dress for the arctic! If you're skiing or snowboarding all day, you'll generally be keeping your body temperature quite high. Invest in a good coat and ski trousers. One will keep you warm, the other will keep your butt dry after you've landed on it for the hundredth time.</p>

                    <p class="gen-ans">Again, this may seem an obvious one - but that fresh powder can look oh so appealing. Seriously though, there are so many horror stories about people getting lost or setting off avalanches - why take the risk?</p>

Cramp is a common occurence and when you're halfway down a vertical slope, it can be pretty inconveninent! Ease yourself in - you've got a whole holiday ahead of you.</p>
